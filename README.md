## Turn-based tennis game

**Project Description**:
- This application will be a turn-based tennis game where the player competes against the computer.
In each turn, the player will choose an action in an attempt to prevent the computer from returning
the ball. 
- The project can be used by anyone but is specifically targeted towards tennis/sports enthusiasts.
- This project is of interest to me baecause I am an avid tennis player and tennis *enjoyer*
