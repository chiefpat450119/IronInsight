## Strength training personal benchmark/progress tracker

**Project Description**:
- This application will be a strength training tracking system. 
Users will be able to record their goals and details of their training sessions.
- The application can be used by gym-goers of with any level of experience, but is specifically 
targeted towards those who are serious about long-term strength goals.
- This project is of interest to me because I am an avid fitness enthusiast and gym *enjoyer*

- As a user, I want to be able to add goals, training records, or personal best results to my training log.
- As a user, I want to be able to record my progress on any exercise.
- As a user, I want to be able to get a list of all my goals and training records
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate my 1-repetition maximum based on the weight I am currently training with.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a goal as completed.
- As a user, I want to be able to save all my logs and goals if I wish to, from the main menu.

## Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to adding goals, training records, or personal best results 
to a training log by clicking on the Home tab and using the text fields to specify personal bests, regular 
workout records, or goals then clicking the "add" button. You can add arbitrarily many of each.
- You can generate the second required action related to adding log entries by going to the goals tab, which allows you 
to mark goals as completed. 
- Another related action is the option to filter log entries by date using the search bar in the Progress tab.
- You can find all the log entries of different types listed in the Progress tab, where you can view details.
- You can locate my visual component by adding a log entry or a goal, or by marking a goal completed, 
which creates an image popup. 
- You can save the state of my application by clicking on "File" in the menu bar at the top, and selecting 
"save logs to file."

## Phase 4: Task 3
Add a section at the end of your README.md file entitled "Phase 4: Task 3".  Reflect on the design presented in your UML class diagram.  
If you had more time to work on the project, what refactoring might you use to improve your design?  
(Everyone can find something. It's fine if it's a tradeoff and not a strict improvement!) 
In 1-2 paragraphs in this section of your README, describe the refactoring and your reasons for it.  
You do not need to perform the refactoring - just identify the changes you would make if you had more time.  Keep in mind that refactoring does not mean adding more features to your application.
